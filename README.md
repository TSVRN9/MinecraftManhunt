# Minecraft Manhunt
________
Yes, this is inspired by Dream's Minecraft Manhunt videos.
I hacked this together in a couple hours so I could play this with my friends.
But, none of us are very good at the game.
Therefore, this plugin features lots of (soon-to-be) configurable handicaps.
A full list can be found at [Configuration & Features](#configuration--features)
## Installation
Clone and build the maven package by running 
```
mvn compile
mvn package
```
This will leave build the jar file in `./target`. 
Copy or move `MinecraftManhunt-X.X.jar` into the `/plugins` folder of your server.
